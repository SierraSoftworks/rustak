//!
//! [`include_dir!`] resolves at compile time, so `rustak-ui/dist` has to be present
//! for `web::ui` to build even when the UI itself has not been built — a fresh clone,
//! or any `cargo build` that does not run `trunk` first.
//!
//! That used to be arranged by committing a `.gitkeep` into the directory, but
//! `trunk build` wipes its output directory on every run and took the marker with
//! it, leaving the working tree dirty after an ordinary UI build. Creating the
//! directory here means nothing has to be tracked inside it, so `rustak-ui/dist`
//! can be ignored wholesale.
